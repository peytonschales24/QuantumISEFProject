# Identification of Correlated Qubit Errors on Quantum Computers

This is a repository for the Python code I used when doing my
experiments on correlated qubit errors. This code is from several
years ago when I was in high school, so excuse the quality. I haven't
tested it, but it is likely that it will need some changes because it
used a version of Qiskit from 2020, and probably will not work with
the current version of Qiskit.
